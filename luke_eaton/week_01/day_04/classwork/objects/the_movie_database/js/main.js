/*The Movie Database
It's like IMDB, but much much smaller!

Create an object to store the following information about your favorite movie: title (a string), duration (a number), and stars (an array of strings).
Create a function to print out the movie information like so: "Puff the Magic Dragon lasts for 30 minutes. Stars: Puff, Jackie, Living Sneezes."*/

console.log("connected");

const movie = {
  title: "hereditary",
  duration: 127, //minutes
  stars: [' toni collette ', ' gabrielle byrne ', ' alex wolff ', ' milly shapiro '] //actors
}

function myFunction( title, duration, stars ) {
    return ${ title }, lasts for ${ duration }, ${ stars: };

    }
//"Puff the Magic Dragon lasts for 30 minutes. Stars: Puff, Jackie, Living Sneezes."
