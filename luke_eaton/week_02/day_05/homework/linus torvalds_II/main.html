  <h1>:~$Linus_Torvalds</h1>

  <p>~ Linus Benedict Torvalds, Swedish: born December 28, 1969) is a Finnish-American software engineer who is the creator, and historically, the principal developer of the Linux kernel, which became the kernel for operating systems such as the Linux operating
  systems, Android, and Chrome OS. He also created the distributed revision control system Git and the diving logging and planning software Subsurface. He was honored, along with Shinya Yamanaka, with the 2012 Millennium Technology Prize by the Technology
  Academy Finland "in recognition of his creation of a new open source operating system for computers leading to the widely used Linux kernel".</p>

  <p>~ The linux Kernel and operating sysytem is used around the world on millions and millions of devices. From small things like the Rasberry Pi and android phones, all the way through to massive projects, like the Hadron Collider Which you can learn about <a class="title" href="hadron.html">[here]</a>.Basically the aim of the LHC is to allow physicists to test the predictions of different theories of particle physics, including measuring the properties of the <a class="title" href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Higgs_boson" target="_blank">[Higgs boson]</a> (Higgs boson, also known by its nickname the "God particle,"an invisible energy field present throughout the universe that imbues other particles with mass.) and searching for the large family of new particles predicted by supersymmetric theories, as well as other unsolved questions of physics..
  </p>
  <p>~ I personally feel he has not had the recognition deserved for his effect on humanity. Don't get me wrong. He has received many awards and is held in high praise within technologically focused fields. Such as-</p>

    <ul>
      <li>In 2000, he was 17th in their Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century poll.</li>
      <li>In 2004, he was named one of the most influential people in the world by Time magazine.</li>
      <li>In 2006, the Europe edition named him one of the revolutionary heroes of the past 60 years.</li>
    </ul>


    <p>He is still to receive the same cultural praise someone might have like Steve Jobs, whose work pales in comparison.</p>
    <p>A lot of things that you use or interact with on a daily basis are running on Linux...It is ubiquitous.        Here are some of the major companies you may know about that either run, or are created from Linux.</p>
