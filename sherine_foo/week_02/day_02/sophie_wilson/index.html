          <p> “In the actual business environment of IT and hardware, patents are decisive to ensure your long-term success.” ~ Sophie Wilson.</p>

          <p> Not every technological genius has the profile of Apple's Steve Jobs or Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web. But that doesn't make their contributions any less profound. Sophie Wilson is a case in point. There is little doubt that Wilson's groundbreaking work has given her a rightful place among the seminal architects of the modern computer-driven world.

          <h3>WHO is Sophie Wilson</h3>

          <img src = "img/sophie_wilson-1.jpg"/>

          <p> Sophie Wilson is a computer scientist who designed the architecture behind the Acorn Micro-Computer — the first computer sold by British technology company, Acorn Computers. She has also made significant contributions to the development of the ARM microprocessor, found in over half of the world’s consumer electronics, and the Firepath processor that supports broadband infrastructure worldwide.</p>

          <p>In 1981, Sophie extended Acorn’s home computer BASIC programming language. A more advanced microcomputer that ensued won the company a contract with the BBC and spawned the BBC Micro, for which the BBC BASIC programming language was developed. Sophie then designed the instruction set for the ARM microprocessor, which later became one of the most successful licenced computer cores.</p>

          <p>Sophie designed the VLIW FirePath processor architecture and was part of a start-up to exploit the processor, which was subsequently bought by US ‘fabless’ semiconductor company Broadcom. Sophie is now Senior Technical Director for Broadcom where she is still developing FirePath. She was elected a Fellow of the Computer History Museum in Silicon Valley in 2012.
