            Wiener always shared his theories and findings with other researchers, including Soviet researchers. Wiener's acquaintance with them caused him to be regarded with suspicion during the Cold War.

        <strong>Cybernetics</strong>  <br />
  Wiener’s work with guided missile technology and ballistics both played a role in his interest in what we now refer to as cybernetics. His interest lay in the complex electronic systems that allowed the missile to change flight based on the current position and direction it was taking. He identified the feedback principle on the missiles and how it played an important role in every living thing in the world—from plants to animals to humans. The feedback principle is an electronics principle that refers to how a measure of an output signal from a system is fed back into the input of the very same system. This principle allows for various systems to be controlled in a way that deals with undesired states or signals, which helps improve system stability.

  Wiener took the concept of the feedback principle as it pertains to electronics and used it to publish his book Cybernetics, which came out in 1948. Cybernetics is the study of many systems, such as mechanical, physical, social and cognitive systems. In simple terms, the idea behind cybernetics is to controlling any system through technology. Cybernetics applies to systems where the system in question has a closed signaling loop. In other words, the specific system’s actions cause a change in the environment where it is present, with the changes reflected back to the system as feedback. As the changes are fed back to the system, it changes according to its programming.

  Aside from cybernetics, Wiener also published many of his theories on the topics of robotics, automation and computer control. One of the reasons Wiener had so much success developing and adapting these theories is because of how well he worked with other mathematicians and experts in their respective fields. Wiener had a reputation of working positively with others, while he always gave credit to these individuals when his final papers or findings included information he had obtained through discussions with them.
