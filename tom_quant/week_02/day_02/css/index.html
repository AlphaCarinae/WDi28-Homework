            Wiener always shared his theories and findings with other researchers, including Soviet researchers. Wiener's acquaintance with them caused him to be regarded with suspicion during the Cold War.

            The Wiener sausage is a neighborhood of the trace of a Brownian motion up to a time t, given by taking all points within a fixed distance of Brownian motion.

        <h3>Norbert Wiener was an American mathematician and philosopher.</h3>

        <p class='content'>
          He was a professor of mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). A child prodigy, Wiener later became an early researcher in stochastic and mathematical noise processes, contributing work relevant to electronic engineering, electronic
          communication, and control systems. Wiener is considered the originator of cybernetics, a formalization of the notion of feedback, with implications for engineering, systems control, computer science, biology, neuroscience, philosophy, and the
          organization of society. Norbert Wiener invented the field of cybernetics, inspiring a generation of scientists to think of computer technology as a means to extend human capabilities.
          <br /><br /><br />
          <Strong>Legacy</Strong><br /> While it is easy to list the accolades of Norbert Wiener, along with the many theorems and concepts he introduced, it is not a full reflection of his importance. Another reason why Wiener is always going to have an important place in
          history is due of his influence on scientists in the present and future generations. Many scientists and researchers drew inspiration from Wiener’s work on cybernetics and sophisticated electronics. For example, the SAGE, or Semi-Automatic Ground
          Environment, program was inspired by Wiener’s work. The SAGE program used massive computer systems to receive data from multiple data sites in order to create a unified image of the airspace over a particular area. It played a particularly important
          role in the Cold War, along with future military engagements. Some of the most prominent developers who played a key role in the creation of the Internet cited Wiener as someone whose work inspired them with their efforts, with J.C.R. Licklider
          being one of the most famous of those individuals.
