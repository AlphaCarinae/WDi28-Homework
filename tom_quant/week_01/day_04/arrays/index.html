// Define a function sumArray and a function multiplyArray that sums and multiplies (respectively) all the numbers in an array of numbers. For example, sumArray([1,2,3,4]) should return 10, and multiplyArray([1,2,3,4]) should return 24.

Define a function reverseString that computes the reversal of a string. For example, reverseString("jag testar") should return the string "ratset gaj".
Write a function findLongestWord that takes an array of words and returns the length of the longest one.
Write a function filterLongWords that takes an array of words and an number i and returns the array of words that are longer than i.


You'll create a simple word guessing game where the user gets infinite tries to guess the word (like Hangman without the hangman, or like Wheel of Fortune without the wheel and fortune).

Create two global arrays: one to hold the letters of the word (e.g. 'F', 'O', 'X'), and one to hold the current guessed letters (e.g. it would start with '_', '_', '_' and end with 'F', 'O', 'X').
Write a function called guessLetter that will:
Take one argument, the guessed letter.
Iterate through the word letters and see if the guessed letter is in there.
If the guessed letter matches a word letter, changed the guessed letters array to reflect that.
When it's done iterating, it should log the current guessed letters ('F__') and congratulate the user if they found a new letter.
It should also figure out if there are any more letters that need to be guessed, and if not, it should congratulate the user for winning the game.
Pretend you don't know the word, and call guessLetter multiple times with various letters to check that your program works.


Start with a reward amount of $0
Every time a letter is guessed, generate a random amount and reward the user if they found a letter (multiplying the reward if multiple letters found), otherwise subtract from their reward.
When they guess the word, log their final reward amount.
